--Abstract Research Paper--
Brent Crude Oil is one of the two main benchmark prices for purchasing oil in the world market. Forecasting crude oil prices is important as it affects a wide range of significant sectors of the economy. This paper proposes the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), exponential smoothing (ETS), and neural network autoregression models (NNAR) for forecasting Brent Crude Oil prices. Also, Na√Øve, Drift and Mean are included as benchmark models. The study adopts the data on Brent Crude Oil closing price from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED). In the model identification process, three models are selected: ARIMA(0,1,0)(2,0,1); ETS(A,N,N); and NNAR(23,1,13). To conclude, the models are evaluated by RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and MASE. Subsequently, this study recommends ETS(A,N,N), as it outperforms the others in terms of the given forecast accuracies.
